                    <h1>Miami advances to NBA finals seven times, Denver has an absolute advantage</h1>
                    <p>The Miami Heat defeated the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals on the 30th to advance to the NBA Finals</p> <br><br><br>
                    <p class="key_content">
                        The Boston Celtics were expected to win three consecutive games after three consecutive losses and make a historic record in Game 7 at home, but the NBA record dominated the Miami Heat as the winner.
                        In 151 NBA playoffs history, no team has won four consecutive games after three losses. 
                        Miami, in particular, repaid its revenge for losing to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference final last year with three wins and four losses. 
                        This is the seventh time that they have advanced to the finals since 2006. 
                        It is the highest number in the NBA during this period.
